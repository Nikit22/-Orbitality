**When:** January 2020 ❄

**Result:** Got offer, but declined 🐱‍👤

### Description:

This is planetary artillery arcade in pseudo 2D (i.e. 2D game in 3D world).
Player is in control of a planet, rotating around Sun. Planet can shoot rockets from it’s
forward point, rockets obey gravity (of Sun and of other planets) meaning they fly in parabolic trajectories. 
On collision with Sun, rocket disappears, on collision with planet - does damage.
I had to create singleplayer game mode with AI players (random number from configurable min/max values).

Rest of features:
  * ✅ Planets should be visually different (and random)
  * ✅ Implement 3 types of rockets with different base stats (acceleration, weight, cooldown etc), which are distributed randomly amongst planets
  * ✅ Pause/resume feature
  * ❌ Save/load feature
  * ✅ UI: main menu, HUD, planet HUD (HP bar, shooting cooldown)
